## 📊 Project Workflow

### 1. **SQL Work**
- Connected MySQL database with the dataset
- Ran exploratory and analytical queries using `GROUP BY`, `JOIN`, `ORDER BY`, etc.
- Filtered and extracted useful segments for analysis

### 2. **Jupyter Notebooks**
- **File 1**: Loaded dataset → Cleaned column names → Handled nulls → Saved cleaned dataset
- **File 2**: Connected MySQL to Jupyter using `sqlalchemy` → Queried and visualized with `matplotlib` & `seaborn`

### 3. **Power BI**
- Loaded the cleaned dataset
- Built interactive visuals:
  - Stacked Column & Area Charts
  - Pie & Donut Charts
  - Waterfall, Line, Scatter, and 100% Stacked Columns
- Generated a 1-page dashboard with all visuals exported as PDF

### 4. **MS Excel**
- Converted dataset into Excel Table
- Built Pivot Tables for deeper categorical analysis
- Used:
  - Clustered Column Charts
  - Pie Charts
  - 100% Stacked Column Visuals
- Exported final 6-page report as PDF
